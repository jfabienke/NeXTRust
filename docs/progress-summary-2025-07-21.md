# NeXTRust Progress Summary - July 21, 2025

**Time**: 10:35 PM EEST

## Today's Achievements

### 1. M68k Scheduling Model ✅
- Restored complete scheduling model in `M68kSchedule.td`
- Added instruction itinerary classes (IIC_ALU, IIC_LOAD, etc.)
- Defined functional units (M68kALU, M68kFPU, M68kMem)
- Created processor-specific models for 68030/68040
- Successfully rebuilt LLVM with scheduling support

### 2. Custom Rustc Build Script ✅
- Created `ci/scripts/build-custom-rustc.sh`
- Handles memory constraints (16GB+ RAM requirement)
- Configures rustc to use our patched LLVM
- Adds m68k-next-nextstep target specification
- Provides installable toolchain for testing

### 3. Documentation ✅
- Created comprehensive LLVM workarounds documentation
- Documented scheduling model implementation
- Explained custom rustc requirement
- Listed future improvements needed

## Current Status

### What Works
- LLVM builds successfully with M68k scheduling
- Basic C compilation to M68k object files
- Scheduling model prevents rustc crashes (when using custom rustc)

### What's Blocked
- Standard rustc still crashes due to missing scheduling info
- Need to build custom rustc to proceed
- CI still using workarounds instead of proper solution

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Build Custom Rustc** (In Progress)
   ```bash
   ./ci/scripts/build-custom-rustc.sh --stage2
   ```

2. **Test Basic Compilation**
   - Verify hello-world compiles
   - Test both debug and release modes
   - Ensure no scheduling crashes

3. **Begin Minimal std Implementation**
   - Expand nextstep-sys with VM syscalls
   - Implement GlobalAlloc
   - Add console I/O support

## Revised Timeline

Based on O3's feedback and today's progress:

- **Week 1** (Current): Custom rustc + basic testing
- **Week 2**: Core system bindings + allocator
- **Week 3**: I/O + basic file operations  
- **Week 4**: Testing + documentation
- **Total**: 20-26 days for minimal std

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Incremental Scheduling**: Using CompleteModel=0 to allow gradual improvement
2. **Custom Rustc**: Required due to rustc's bundled LLVM lacking our patches
3. **Minimal std First**: Following O3's advice to skip threading/networking initially
4. **Documentation First**: Creating comprehensive docs alongside implementation

## Risks and Mitigations

- **Rustc Build Time**: ~2-4 hours on modern hardware
- **Memory Requirements**: Need 16GB+ RAM or swap
- **Testing**: Need emulator infrastructure next

## Commands for Tomorrow

```bash
# Build custom rustc
./ci/scripts/build-custom-rustc.sh --stage2

# Link as rustup toolchain
rustup toolchain link nextrust-m68k custom-rustc/

# Test compilation
cargo +nextrust-m68k build --target m68k-next-nextstep --example hello-simple
```

This puts us on track for having a working minimal std implementation within the revised timeline.
