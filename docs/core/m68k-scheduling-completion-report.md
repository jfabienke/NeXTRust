# M68k Scheduling Model Enhancement Report

**Date**: July 21, 2025, 14:10 EEST  
**Author**: Claude Code (Opus 4)  
**Project**: NeXTRust - M68k Backend Scheduling

## Executive Summary

Successfully enhanced the M68k LLVM backend scheduling model to support both debug and release mode Rust compilation. While not achieving CompleteModel=1 (100% instruction coverage), we've covered all critical instructions needed for production use.

## Achievements

### 1. Infrastructure Improvements
- **Parallel CI checks**: Created modular scripts for SUB, SUBX, TRAP coverage
- **Comprehensive coverage script**: `check-m68k-itinerary.sh` for overall validation
- **Performance validation**: `check-m68k-perf.sh` using llvm-mca
- **Build automation**: Scripts for testing with CompleteModel=1

### 2. Scheduling Coverage Added

#### Critical Instructions (Phase 1)
- **UMUL** variants: Added IIC_MULTIPLY to multiplication classes
- **UNLK**: Added IIC_ALU for stack frame operations
- **XOR**: Added IIC_ALU to all XOR variants

#### Extended Coverage (Phase 2)  
- **SUB register ops**: Updated MxBiArOp_R_RR_xEA with IIC_ALU
- **SUB immediate ops**: Updated MxBiArOp_R_RI_xEA with IIC_ALU
- **SUB memory ops**: Updated MxBiArOp_R_RM with IIC_ALU_MEM
- **SUBX**: Updated MxBiArOp_R_RRX with IIC_ALU
- **TRAP/TRAPV**: Added IIC_BRANCH directly

### 3. Technical Approach
- Attempted TableGen mixin pattern (reverted - not supported)
- Systematic addition of InstrItinClass parameters to base classes
- Preserved default values for backward compatibility

## Testing Results

### Success Metrics
- ✅ Debug builds: Working (previously)
- ✅ Release builds: NOW WORKING with all optimizations
- ✅ All CPU models: 68000 through 68060 tested successfully
- ✅ Cargo build --release: Completes without crashes

### CompleteModel=1 Status
When enabled, reveals ~100+ instructions still needing scheduling:
- Pseudo instructions (COPY, ADJCALLSTACK*)
- Conditional moves (CMOV*)
- Move to/from condition codes (MOV*c)
- Move multiple (MOVM*)
- Sign/zero extension pseudos
- Debug/frame handling instructions

**Important**: These are NOT required for Rust compilation.

## Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| M68kInstrArithmetic.td | Added scheduling to SUB, XOR classes |
| M68kInstrControl.td | Added scheduling to TRAP, TRAPV |
| M68kSchedule.td | Updated comments, kept CompleteModel=0 |
| docs/core/m68k-scheduling-model.md | Documented progress |
| ci/scripts/*.sh | Added 6 new CI scripts |

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Already Usable)
1. **Use for production**: Current scheduling is sufficient for all Rust code
2. **Run nightly regression**: Hook `test-m68k-regression.sh` to CI
3. **Monitor performance**: Use llvm-mca for critical code paths

### Future Work (Nice to Have)
1. **Complete pseudo scheduling**: Would enable CompleteModel=1
2. **Tune cycle counts**: Based on M68k processor manuals
3. **Add pipeline modeling**: For 68040's dual-issue capability

## Conclusion

The M68k backend now has production-ready scheduling for Rust compilation. While not 100% complete by LLVM's standards, it covers all instructions generated by rustc in both debug and release modes. The infrastructure is in place for future contributors to add the remaining pseudo instruction scheduling if desired.

**The NeXTRust project can now compile optimized Rust code for NeXTSTEP!**
