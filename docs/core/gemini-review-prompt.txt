Please review this technical report documenting the resolution of a rustc crash for the m68k-next-nextstep target.

Context: This is part of the NeXTRust project enabling Rust development for historic NeXTSTEP systems on m68k architecture. The report describes how we fixed a critical compiler crash in LLVM's SelectionDAG scheduling phase.

Key areas to review:
1. Technical accuracy of the M68k scheduling model implementation
2. Completeness of the TableGen definitions (FuncUnits, Itineraries, etc.)
3. Appropriateness of cycle counts for M68k processors
4. Quality of the O3 integration updates
5. Clarity and completeness of the documentation

Specific questions:
- Are the cycle counts realistic for M68k processors (especially 68030/68040)?
- Is setting CompleteModel=0 acceptable as a temporary solution?
- Should we add more instruction itinerary classes?
- Are there any M68k-specific scheduling concerns we missed?
