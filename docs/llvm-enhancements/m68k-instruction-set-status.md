## Summary Statistics

### By Category
- **Control Flow**: 9/19 machine instructions implemented (47%)
- **Data Movement**: 4/14 machine instructions implemented (29%)
- **Arithmetic**: 13/26 instructions implemented (50%)
- **Logical**: 7/7 instructions implemented (100%)
- **Shift/Rotate**: 5/8 instructions implemented (63%)
- **Bit Manipulation**: 1/4 instructions implemented (25%)
- **Atomic**: 2/3 instructions implemented (67%)

### Overall
- **Total Instructions**: ~100 distinct M68k instructions
- **Implemented/Usable**: ~45 instructions (45%)
- **Not Implemented**: ~55 instructions (55%)

## Key Limitations

1. **No Floating-Point Control**: Missing all FPU control and status instructions
2. **Limited Bit Manipulation**: Only BTST is usable, missing BCHG, BCLR, BSET
3. **No Quick Instructions**: Missing ADDQ, SUBQ, MOVEQ which are important for code density
4. **No Peripheral Support**: Missing MOVEP instruction used for peripheral access
5. **Limited Multi-Register**: MOVEM only partially implemented
6. **No Advanced Features**: Missing CMP2, CHK2, CAS2, PACK, UNPK

## Implications for Code Generation

The current LLVM M68k backend can generate functional code for:
- Basic arithmetic and logical operations
- Simple control flow (branches, jumps, returns)
- Basic data movement
- Simple atomic operations

It cannot generate optimal code due to missing:
- Quick instructions (forcing larger immediate encodings)
- Advanced addressing modes
- Specialized instructions for common patterns

## Recommendations

For the NeXTRust project targeting NeXTSTEP on M68k:
1. The current instruction set is sufficient for basic functionality
2. Missing instructions can be worked around with instruction sequences
3. Code density will be suboptimal without quick instructions
4. Floating-point code will work but lacks advanced features
5. System-level code may need assembly for missing instructions
