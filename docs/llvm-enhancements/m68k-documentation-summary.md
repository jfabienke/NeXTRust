# M68k LLVM Documentation Summary

*Created: July 23, 2025 08:10 EEST*

## Documentation Created

### 1. M68k Instruction Set Implementation Status
**File**: `m68k-instruction-set-status.md`

Comprehensive documentation of:
- All M68k instructions and their LLVM implementation status
- Categorization by instruction type (Control Flow, Data Movement, etc.)
- Summary statistics: ~45% of instructions implemented
- Key limitations and implications for code generation

### 2. M68060 Removed Instructions
**File**: `m68060-removed-instructions.md`

Complete listing of:
- Integer instructions removed: MOVEP, CAS2, CHK2, CMP2, 64-bit MUL/DIV
- FPU instructions removed: All transcendental functions
- Exception handling (vector 61)
- Software emulation via M68060SP
- Performance trade-offs and benefits

### 3. M68k Emulator Compatibility Guide
**File**: `m68k-emulator-compatibility.md`

Detailed comparison of:
- Previous emulator (recommended for NeXTRust)
- WinUAE CPU core capabilities
- MAME limitations
- Testing recommendations
- Debugging features

### 4. M68kSchedule.td Updates
Added comprehensive comments:
- Links to documentation files
- 68060 removed instruction notes
- Emulator testing recommendations
- TODO for future UnsupportedFeatures implementation

## Key Findings

1. **LLVM Status**: Basic functionality exists but many instructions missing
2. **68060 Strategy**: Removed instructions for superscalar performance
3. **Emulator Choice**: Previous is best for NeXTSTEP testing
4. **Future Work**: Need feature flags when missing instructions are implemented

## Integration

All documentation is:
- Cross-referenced between files
- Linked from main LLVM enhancements document
- Referenced in M68kSchedule.td source comments
- Ready for developer use

This documentation provides essential reference material for anyone working on M68k code generation in LLVM, especially for the NeXTRust project.
