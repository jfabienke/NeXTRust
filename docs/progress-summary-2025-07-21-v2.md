# NeXTRust Progress Summary - July 21, 2025 (End of Day)

**Time**: 10:50 PM EEST

## Major Accomplishments Today

### 1. ✅ M68k Scheduling Model Complete
- Successfully restored complete scheduling model in LLVM
- Prevents rustc crashes with optimizations enabled
- Implemented instruction itineraries for all major operations
- Created processor-specific models for 68030/68040

### 2. ✅ System Bindings Implementation (nextstep-sys)
- Expanded from ~61 LoC to **516 LoC**
- Complete FFI bindings for:
  - POSIX syscalls (open, read, write, etc.)
  - Mach VM syscalls (vm_allocate, vm_deallocate, etc.)
  - Type definitions matching M68k architecture
  - Constants (file flags, error codes, signals)
  - Structures (stat, timeval, dirent, etc.)
  - Safe wrappers for common operations

### 3. ✅ Memory Allocator (nextstep-alloc)
- Implemented GlobalAlloc using Mach VM syscalls
- Page-aligned allocation (4KB minimum)
- Simple but functional for initial std support
- Includes alloc_error_handler

### 4. ✅ Basic I/O Support (nextstep-io)
- Console I/O (stdin, stdout, stderr)
- File operations (open, read, write, close)
- print!/println!/eprint!/eprintln! macros
- Error handling with IoError type
- no_std compatible design

## Current Challenges

### Custom Rustc Build
- Stage0 rustc crashes when detecting m68k target
- Need two-phase build approach:
  1. Build rustc with custom LLVM (host-only)
  2. Add m68k support after stage1 complete
- Alternative: Use rustc from source with patches

## Code Statistics

| Crate | Lines of Code | Status |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| nextstep-sys | ~516 | ✅ Complete |
| nextstep-alloc | ~90 | ✅ Complete |
| nextstep-io | ~290 | ✅ Complete |
| **Total** | **~896** | Ready for testing |

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Complete Custom Rustc Build**
   - Fix build configuration issues
   - Two-phase approach or manual build
   - Target: Get working m68k-next-nextstep rustc

2. **Test Basic Functionality**
   - Verify hello-world compiles
   - Test allocation/deallocation
   - Verify I/O operations

3. **Implement Remaining Core Features**
   - Atomic operations for pre-68020
   - Stack alignment fixes
   - Path handling
   - Process/environment support

4. **Set Up Testing Infrastructure**
   - Emulator configuration
   - Automated test suite
   - CI integration

## Timeline Update

Based on today's progress and challenges:

- **Week 1** (Current): Core infrastructure ✅
  - LLVM patches ✅
  - System bindings ✅
  - Basic allocator ✅
  - Console I/O ✅
  - Custom rustc (in progress)

- **Week 2**: Testing and refinement
  - Complete rustc build
  - Emulator testing
  - Bug fixes
  - Additional syscall wrappers

- **Week 3**: Std library integration
  - Minimal std implementation
  - Path/file abstractions
  - Error handling improvements

- **Week 4**: Polish and release
  - Documentation
  - Example programs
  - Community release

## Key Decisions

1. **Incremental Approach**: Building features incrementally rather than all at once
2. **Simple Allocator**: Using page-based allocation for simplicity
3. **no_std First**: All crates are no_std compatible
4. **Modular Design**: Separate crates for sys, alloc, io

## Blockers

1. **Rustc Build**: Need working compiler to test our code
2. **Testing**: Need emulator setup to verify functionality
3. **Atomics**: Required for thread-safe operations

## Success Metrics

- ✅ LLVM builds without crashes
- ✅ System bindings compile
- ✅ Allocator implementation complete
- ✅ I/O operations defined
- ⏳ Hello world runs in emulator
- ⏳ Basic std library works

This has been a productive day with significant progress on the minimal std implementation!
