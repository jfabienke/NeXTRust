and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.5] - 2025-07-22 (Evening Update)

### Added
- Custom LLVM 17 build with M68k Mach-O support
- Rust 1.77 build with custom LLVM backend
- Automated build scripts for entire toolchain
- Comprehensive build documentation:
  - `docs/rust-1.77-build-guide.md`
  - `docs/progress-report-2025-07-22.md`
- M68k instruction scheduling fix (NoModel = 1)
- Alternative target specifications for testing
- xargo integration for building core library

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Resolved SIGSEGV crashes in LLVM M68k instruction scheduling
- zstd library path issues on Apple Silicon Macs
- Missing AArch64 target in LLVM for Apple Silicon hosts
- dsymutil debug info errors during Rust builds
- FileCheck utility missing from LLVM installation

### Changed
- Modified M68k backend to disable instruction scheduling entirely
- Updated LLVM to include X86, M68k, and AArch64 targets
- Enhanced build scripts with better error handling
- Revised build process to use Rust 1.77 (LLVM 17 compatible)

### Technical Breakthrough
- Successfully built working toolchain:
  - LLVM 17.0.6 with M68k patches
  - Rust 1.77.0 with custom LLVM
  - Verified rustc can target m68k-next-nextstep
- Ready to build core library and test binaries

## [2.4] - 2025-07-22 (Morning Update)

### Added
- Core runtime libraries implementation:
  - `nextstep-sys`: Complete FFI bindings (~516 lines) for all major NeXTSTEP syscalls
  - `nextstep-alloc`: Custom allocator using Mach VM operations (vm_allocate/vm_deallocate)
  - `nextstep-io`: Basic I/O traits with stdout/stderr support
- Comprehensive type definitions matching M68k 32-bit big-endian architecture
- Safe wrapper functions for common syscalls (write, read, open, close, etc.)
- Documentation for nextstep-sys implementation progress

### Fixed
- Resolved LLVM scheduling model issue that was blocking release builds
- Fixed missing scheduling information for critical M68k instructions

### Changed
- Updated project documentation to reflect current implementation status
- Revised timeline estimates based on rustc cross-compilation challenges

### Known Issues (Now Resolved)
- ~~Critical Blocker: Cannot build rustc with m68k-next-nextstep target~~ âœ… FIXED in v2.5

### Technical Progress
- Phase 3 effectively complete with core runtime libraries implemented
- Early Phase 4 work begun with library implementations
- Emulator testing now unblocked with working toolchain

## [2.3] - 2025-07-21

### Added
- M68k scheduling model enhancements for release build support
- Scheduling information for critical instructions (SUB, SUBX, TRAP, UMUL, UNLK, XOR)
- Parallel CI coverage check scripts for instruction families
- Performance validation script using llvm-mca
- Comprehensive scheduling documentation and completion report

### Fixed
- Release mode compilation crashes due to missing scheduling information
- SelectionDAG issues when optimizations enabled
- Rust compilation with -O1, -O2, -O3 optimization levels

### Changed
- Enhanced M68k LLVM backend with production-ready scheduling
- Updated CLAUDE.md and README.md to reflect Phase 3 completion
- Improved CI scripts for parallel testing of instruction coverage

### Technical Details
- Added InstrItinClass parameters to TableGen instruction definitions
- Implemented IIC_ALU, IIC_ALU_MEM, IIC_BRANCH scheduling classes
- ~100 pseudo instructions remain unscheduled (not needed for Rust)
- CompleteModel remains 0 (full coverage not required for production)

## [2.2] - 2025-07-20

### Added
- AI-powered CI/CD pipeline with automated code reviews
- OpenAI O3 integration for complex design decisions
- Gemini integration for PR reviews and code feedback
- Budget monitoring and enforcement system
- Slash commands for manual AI assistance triggers
- Comprehensive metrics emission (JSONL format)
- Token usage tracking with ccusage integration
- Phase completion hooks for automated workflows
- Local test environment configuration support
- Developer setup template (local.env.template)

### Fixed
- Created missing `ci/scripts/check-ccusage.sh` script
- Fixed test harness to properly use test credentials
- Corrected dispatcher filename references (dispatcher.sh vs dispatcher-v2.sh)
- Added proper error handling for missing dependencies

### Changed
- Updated CI/CD architecture to v2.2 with full AI activation
- Enhanced hook system with modular dispatcher architecture
- Improved test coverage from 0 to 23 passing tests

### Verified
- Full local test suite: 23/23 tests passing
